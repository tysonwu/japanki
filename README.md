##  Preparing the data

The list of Japanese N5 vocabularies is obtained from 9elt's project [jlpt-n5-word-list](https://github.com/9elt/jlpt-n5-word-list) with further processing with basic Python:

- Converting into .csv format
- Adding romaji for learning using [Cutlet](https://github.com/polm/cutlet)
- Manually deciding a category for grouping of vocabularies as I don't enjoy learning vocabs in alphabetical order.

The data processing is a one-time process and therefore excluded from the repository.
